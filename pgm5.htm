<H1>Perl Assignment #5</H1>
<H1>Due: April 30th, 7PM</H1>
<HR>
<PRE>Objective: Use what we've learned about file and directory operations
Estimated Time: 3Hrs. - 4Hrs.  (Most time will be spent debugging)
=====================================================================

This program will start in the current directory and list all the files in it.

If there are directories in the current directory, the program will then list the files in that 
directory, and so on.

If a file ending in .txt is found, that filename should be changed so that it ends in .text

If a file with the extension .delete is found, that file should be deleted

If the file tree starting from the current directory is as follows:


               [a(dir) b c  d(dir)]
                  |          |
             [e f(dir) g]  [h  i  j(dir) k(dir)]
                  |		      |       |
                [l.txt]              [m]   [n.delete o]


Then your program should output the following.....

Directory: ./
Files: b c
Directories:a d

Directory: a
Files: e g
Directories: f

Directory: d
Files: h i
Directories: j k

Directory: f
Files: l.text

Directory: j
Files: m

Directory: k
Files: o

Other requirements
==================
You cannot use any modules in this program.
